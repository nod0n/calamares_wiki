## Issue Labels

In 2020 Calamares moved to *labeling* issues, hopefully in a consistent manner.

 - ![Bug](img/issue-bug.png) **Bugs** are labeled in red. There are variations:
   - Bugs caused by (other) bugs in software used by Calamares, are labeled *upstream*.
   - Bugs caused by the way Calamares is delivered to users, or the software it is combined with by distro's, are labeled *downstream*.
