## Developer's Guide

The developer's guide contains information on 
[building](Developer's-Guide.md#build) Calamares,
on its 
[design](Developer's-Guide.md#design),
and [localization](Developer's-Guide.md#i18n).
Much of the technical documentation is in README files in the
source code, though, where it is much closer to the things it
documents. Of particular interest is the `/ci/` directory, which is where things-that-are-not-Calamares-itself but related to Calamares development (like the Continuous Integration scripts, like translation tools, and development documentation) end up.

## Tester's Guide

While developing Calamares, it needs [testing](Tester's-Guide) on virtual or physical machines. The Tester's Guide provides advice on setting up test-systems. It also explains the acceptance tests that should (or might) be done on Calamares.
