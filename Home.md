## Developer's Guide

The developer's guide contains information on 
[building](Developer'sGuide.md#build) Calamares,
on its 
[design](Developer'sGuide.md#design),
and [localization](Developer'sGuide.md#i18n).
Much of the technical documentation is in README.md files in the
source code, though, where it is much closed to the things it
documents.
