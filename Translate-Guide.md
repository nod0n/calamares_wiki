# Translator's Guide

Calamares uses [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) as its translation
inrfastructure. Internally, the program uses Qt translations and GNU
gettext. Translations are (semi-)regularly updated from the *master*
branch of Calamares and sent to Transifex; updated translations are
imported into the same *master* branch.

This means that stable releases don't get translation updates --
I have not thought of a good way to do that with one Calamares
project in Transifex.

## Getting Started

You'll need a Transifex account. Follow their instructions, they
are well-written. Then apply to join the Calamares team.
Give us a shout on IRC or in a Calamares issue, so that we know
you want to join.

## Translation Guidelines

Just do it. Please don't change keyboard shortcuts unless you
really really have to (keyboard shortcuts can be recognized by having
*&letter* in the string).
